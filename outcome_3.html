        <h2>Outcome 3</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>3.1</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I used CSS styling to structure my .html files. I removed the browser's default border, padding and margin values so that I could build the webpage as I saw fit. I fixed the image to the background and made it responsive so that the entire image is always at full size even when the browser window is resized. I created a nav bar which is fixed to the top of the page on every page except the homepage and styled it so the background changes colour when the user hovers over the links. I also used text-align: to center all of the text in the page.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>3.2</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In my research I found a lot of useful resources. The one thing that made the most profound difference to my workflow was the use of shortcuts. Shortcuts such as option + SHIFT + Up/Down(cursor) for quickly copying lines of code was extremely useful. Shortcuts and emmet are very effective tools for staying in the coding flow and reducing keystrokes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>3.3</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In the future, I would develop a colour scheme and then list the rgb values in a note on my computer for easy access. I enjoy working in teams but I don't think my HTML & CSS skills are strong enough to be able to contribute to a team yet. This is something that I'll be working on daily after the course.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>3.4</h3>
        <br>
        <p>While developing this website, I created 'blank' html files where I would copy code that was running well and I would test code that I wasn't too sure about alongside the rest of my code to troubleshoot and better understand the new solutions. It's also important to ensure that your webpages are responsive in browsers other than your own default browser.</p>
