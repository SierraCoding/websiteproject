        <h3>2.1</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I am a big fan of Visual Studio Code. I had some issues with it earlier in the course and I began to use Pycharm instead as I couldn't work out what the error was. I found Pycharm to be quite clunky and visually overwhelming. I also enjoyed using Trello. I like using kanban boards to organise my day-to-day life in general so I found this format to be very intuitive.</p>

        <h3>2.2</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Both Visual Studio Code and Trello were definitely appropriate for the assignments that we were given and I am keen to improve my skills in both applications.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2.3</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I am not happy with my website. It's a much more basic project than I hoped to submit. I wanted to structure everything on one long page and then have animations that neatly scroll between the next pages, but I felt pressured for time. I would also have liked to explore other animations and flexbox but these are things that I will be learning how to use after the course.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2.4</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I would like to add icons with links to my LinkedIn, Github and other social media profiles using CSS. Given more time, I would have also liked to research how to make 'Dark Mode' functionality for my webpage that would create a darker version of my website.</p>
