        <h3>1.1</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When used properly, Technology is one of the most powerful tools in a modern business’s arsenal. Technology can be used to increase efficiency by automating or streamlining various services. For example, checking stock, automatically sending out emails or newsletters, and also allowing employees to work remotely - just to name a few.
        <br><br>
        Technology has become essential for business marketing strategies, largely due to the rise of social media. Proper navigation of the social media marketplaces such as Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, can help a business to easily target specific groups of people. In addition, when combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence, this data can be extrapolated and harnessed to improve the chosen marketing strategy.
        <br><br>
        Websites and services such as Squarespace and Wix have made it much easier for individuals and small business owners to create professional landing and product pages for their business. An effective landing page creates a professional image for the business and can help a business to convert more of their traffic into sales.

        <h3>1.2</h3>
        <br>
        <p>A successful project will always require a clear plan. Firstly, you will need to define what will make the project successful.
        <br><br>
        For example, if you wanted to make an app for the IOS marketplace you would need to decide how it would generate revenue. This could include in-app/in-game purchases, in-game advertisements (which could be permanently disabled with a fee/recurring monthly subscription, or tiered subscription services with various functionality improvements for power users.
        <br><br> 
        Secondly, following on from the app example, you would need to choose a programming language that you’re comfortable with, and you would need to ensure that that the language is suitable for the task and can be scaled as the demands of your project increase.
        <br><br>
        I believe that problem-solving is the main skill required for a successful digital project. You’re bound to run into a bug or an issue that requires solving eventually, and it is likely that you’ll be able to find a solution online with enough digging and critical thought.

        <h3>1.4</h3>
        <br>
        <p>There may be a lack of demand. If you are an established business you should have a considerable amount of data to study and decide whether this particular idea is currently worth your attention. You should observe the patterns in your data and see which products are performing the best and then see whether or not they can be improved.
        <br><br>
        A lack of synergy between front end and back end development. Both maintenance and changes to code need to operate in tandem and changed accordingly to elevate the user’s experience and to translate that improvement into usable data or increased profits that can be monitored and reviewed. This cross-functional expertise is crucial when developing or improving apps, software and hardware. If you’re developing a product for a specific business in mind then your product has to be tailored made for them so it can seamlessly integrate into the business’ workflow. Oversights like this can lead to failure. *(Please See References Below)</p>

        <h3>1.5</h3>
        <br>
        <p>First it would be wise to consider what is not working optimally. Could this system be improved? How so? For example, if communication and collaboration has become inefficient then tools like Slack can be employed.
        <br><br>
        It is also important to consider the future and keep long term goals in mind. Examine potential tech options with scalability in mind. This should keep the need to introduce changes in the future to a minimum, which in turn will keep everything running smoothly.
        <br><br>  
        Cost is one of the biggest factors and this is essential for keep businesses profitable. Expenditure has to be monitored and kept to a minimum as much as possible. There is always a cost involved when introducing unfamiliar systems or software to a team. Time must be designated to training and familiarising them with the new systems and workflow.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>1.6</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I greatly enjoyed using Trello during our game project assignment. It is an excellent collaborative tool that works in real time and helps to map out our ideas in a very aesthetically pleasing manner.
        <br><br>
        I found Trello to be very useful for quickly sharing and storing links to useful resources such as educational videos and tutorials. Trello made the process of returning to these videos very convenient.
        <br><br>   
        Finally, Trello was very useful for tracking and monitoring our workflow. It was easy to see and direct our attention to areas that needed to be prioritised. I found this to be most beneficial while Andy and I were testing our instances of the code.
        <br><br> 
        Zoom was another excellent tool while we were making our game. We used it to hold daily meetings, in which we structured our plans and designated tasks for the day.
        <br><br>    
        GitHub is an excellent online repository for both personal and professional work. It makes collaborative projects more easily and readily accessible and makes version control easier to implement and backup in the cloud.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>1.7</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is the core of Europe’s digital privacy legislation. The GDPR sets out 7 key principles:
        <br><br>
        <ul class ="gdpr">
            <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
            <li>Purpose limitation</li>
            <li>Data minimisation</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
            <li>Storage limitation</li>
            <li>Integrity and confidentiality</li>
            <li>Accountability</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Digital service providers can encounter big financial sanctions for GDPR infringements. These are hugely detrimental to a business’s reputation, image and cash flow. Therefore, it is important that all aspects of a business or digital project adhere to the seven key principles of the GDPR.
