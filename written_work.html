            <h3>1.1</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I used CSS to fix my image to the background and used attributes such as background: center,  attachment, repeat and size to centre the image, fix it in place, prevent it from repeating and thus creating a tiled effect and size to make the image responsize to changes in browser windows or mobile browsers.
            <br><br>
            Each page also has a navbar which I built using unordered list elements in html and then I styled them in CSS. I made the links appear horizontally along the page, removed the underline using the text-decoration: none; attribute and used the hover: attribute to increase the size of the font when the user hovers their mouse over the link.
            </p>

            <p>Given more time, I would have liked to research how to incorporate a warm mode feature for those wishing to minimise their exposure to blue light.
            <br><br>
            I would have also liked to research how to create a magnifying glass effect for the cursor which would magnify the size of text as the user hovers over text.

            <p>JPEG ().jpg/.jpeg) and PNG ().png) are the most commonly used file types for images. JPEG files are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours, however, .png files have the advantage as they give control over transparency.</p>
