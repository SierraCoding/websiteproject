        <h2>My Passions</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>1.0</h3>
        <p>I have a love for all things tech. Music is a huge part of my life. I've been DJing, collecting records and producing electronic music for over 10 years. I'm extremely keen to develop the skills necessary to be able to create my own tailor-made musical software and effects, and further develop my sound.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've just completed the Develop:Coding course at Code Nation, Manchester, which I greatly enjoyed.I learned how to use python and built my first program - a text based riddle game and this website. I'd very much like to 'master' web development. This project was a lot of fun.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After the course, I plan to start working on a more advanced portfolio website. I'll be further developing my HTML & CSS skills and I'd love to add animations and make the website more dynamic and stylised.
        <br><br>
        I'll also start to work on a customised website to showcase my music and my artist profile in a way that truly showcases my vision.</p>
